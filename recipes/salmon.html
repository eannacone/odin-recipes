    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (5 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets</li>
            <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lemon halved, divided</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>6 lemon slices</li>
        </ul>
    <h4><em>Steps</em></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat 
                the oven's broiler. Line a baking pan with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Pour oil into a medium bowl. Rinse salmon fillets and pat dry. Dip 
                fillets into oil, being sure to coat both sides, and place skin-side down 
                into the prepared baking pan. Squeeze as much juice as you can from 1 lemon 
                half over the fillets. Coat both sides of salmon with parsley, oregano, 
                basil, and garlic, and sprinkle with 1/2 of the kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Place under the preheated broiler and cook until center is light 
                pink and edges are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Remove fillets from the oven and immediately plate. Squeeze remaining 
                lemon half over top and sprinkle with remaining kosher salt. Serve with lemon 
                slices.</li>
        </ol>
